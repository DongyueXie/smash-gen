## Introduction

We extend smashgen to allow it smoothing probabilities. Simulations in 1 show that smashgen gives reasonable fits. When n is large and p is small in Binomial(n,p), we can use Poisson to approximate binomial distribution. In 2, we compared smashgen-binomial and smashgen-poi.binomial, as well as other popular smoothing methods(ti.thresh and eb.thresh). In general, smashgen-binomial outperforms the other methods. While we expect that as $n_t$ increases smashgen-poi.binomial should give smaller MSE, this is not the case.
