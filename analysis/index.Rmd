# Project Overview

This project aims to study a generalization version of normal version of smash. It is a version of wavelet denoising for Gaussian where each observation has additional known measurement error. The method is expected to handle the Poisson nugget effect.

# Analysis

1. [Basic review](poireview.html)
2. [Poisson nugget simulation](nugget2.html): assume $\sigma$ is known.
3. [Poisson nugget simulation](nuggetunkown.html): assume $\sigma$ is unknown.

# Credits

This project is based on the ideas from Professor [Matthew Stephens](http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/). Thanks to Matthew Stephens and [Kushal K Dey](https://kkdey.github.io/) for their great help.
