# Project Overview

This project aims to study a generalization version of normal version of smash. It is a version of wavelet denoising for Gaussian where each observation has additional known measurement error. The method is expected to handle the Poisson nugget effect.

I have created a [R package](https://github.com/DongyueXie/smashrgen) for the functions used in the analysis.

# Analysis

## Intial investigation

1. [Basic review](poireview.html)
2. [Poisson nugget simulation](nugget2.html): assume $\sigma$ is known.
3. [A robust version of smash-gen](robustalgo.html): set the highest resolution wavelet coeffs to 0.
4. [Treat Poisson data as normal](iter1.html): only do 1 iteration.
5. [Expanding around ash posterior mean](ashpmean.html): iterate once but the Taylor series expansion is around ash posterior mean(applying ash to Poisson data first).

## Estimate nugget effect

1. [Estimate nugget effect($\sigma$)](sigma.html)
2. [`smash.gaus.gen` to estimate unknown $\sigma$](unknownvar.html)

## Poisson data with unknown nugget effect

1. [Poisson nugget simulation(unknown $\sigma$)](poiunknown.html): $\sigma$ is unknown.
2. [Haar vs Symmlet 8](wavebasis.html)
3. [Poisson data, wavelet basis functions](poiwave.html)
4. [Poisson data, wavelet basis functions:larger mean function](poiwave2.html)
5. [Poisson seq, compare smash and smashgen on the estimate of $\mu$ and $\log\mu$](poiwavelog.html)

## Binomial data with unknown nugget effect

1. [Binomial nugget effect](binomial.html)
2. [Poisson as approximate of Binomial?](poibinom.html)

## Smoothing with covariates

1. [Smoothing with covariates: Gaussian](covariate.html)
2. [Smoothing with covariates: Gaussian, iterative version](covariateiter.html)
3. [Smoothing with covariates: glm](glmcovariate.html)

## Unevenly spaced data

1. [Treat as missing data?](missing.html)

## Chip-Exo and Chip-seq data smoothing

1. [CTCF Chip-exo data, reflection](chipexo.html)
2. [CTCF Chip-exo data, cut](chipexocut.html)
3. [CTCF Chip-seq data](chipseqref.html)
