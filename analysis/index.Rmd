# Project Overview

This project aims to study a generalization version of normal version of smash. It is a version of wavelet denoising for Gaussian where each observation has additional known measurement error. The method is expected to handle the Poisson nugget effect.

# Analysis

1. [Basic review](poireview.html)
2. [Poisson nugget simulation](nugget2.html): assume $\sigma$ is known.
3. [A robust version of smash-gen](robustalgo.html): set the highest resolution wavelet coeffs to 0.
4. [Treat Poisson data as normal](iter1.html): only do 1 iteration.
5. [Expanding around ash posterior mean](ashpmean.html): iterate once but the taylor series expansion is around ash posterior mean(applying ash to Poisson data first).
6. [Estimate nugget effect($\sigma$)](sigma.html)
7. [`smash.gaus.gen` to estimate unknown $\sigma$](unknownvar.html)
8. [Poisson nugget simulation(unknown $\sigma$)](poiunknown.html): $\sigma$ is unknown.
9. [Binomial nugget effect](binomial.html)
10. [Poisson as approximate of Binomial?](poibinom.html)
11. [General GLM version?](glm.html)

I have created a [R package](https://github.com/DongyueXie/smashrgen) for the functions used in the analysis.
