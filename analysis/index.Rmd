# Project Overview

We generalize `smash`(Xing and Stephens, 2016), a flexible empirical Bayes method for signal denoising, to deal with non-Gaussian data, and account for additional unknown variances.

This [R package](https://github.com/DongyueXie/smashrgen) contains functions for this project.

# Analysis

Update on Nov-2019: Only keep useful links here.

## Method

This is a review and summary I wrote in Sept 2018.

[Introduction and method](smoothing.html)

## Intial investigation

[Early stage analysis](initialinvest.html)

## Estimate nugget effect

[Methods on estimating nugget effect](estimatenugget.html). The final method I chose is the MLE estimate of $\sigma^2$ in $y\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2+s^2)$.


## Poisson data with unknown nugget effect

1. [Poisson nugget simulation(unknown $\sigma$)](poiunknown.html): $\sigma$ is unknown.
2. [Fix spike issues](poissonspike.html): updated version, 10/07/2018

[Other analysis](poisson.html) includes different wavelet basis.

## Binomial data with unknown nugget effect

[A summary of binomial sequence smoothing](binomial2.html)

[Other analysis](binomialdata.html) includes using Poisson apporximation.

## Smoothing with covariates

Now suppose at each $t$, $Y_t=X_t\beta+\mu_t+\epsilon_t$, where $\mu$ has smooth structure and $\epsilon_t\sim N(0,\sigma^2_t)$. The structure of $\mu$ cannot be explained by the ordinary least square so it is contained in the residual $e$. Thus $e$ consists of $\mu$ and noises. Using `smash.gaus` recovers $\mu$ and estimates $\sigma^2$.

2. [Smoothing with covariates: Gaussian, iterative version](covariateiter.html)
3. [Smoothing with covariates: glm](glmcovariate.html)
4. [Smoothing with covariates: VST version](covariatevst.html)

## Unevenly spaced data

We treat unevenly spaced data as missing and set them to 0 with corresponding standard error $10^6$. The idea is that if standard error is very big then value of y becomes irrelevant. It doesn't work.

## Chip-Exo and Chip-seq data smoothing

Some real data applications of smashgen. One problem is that the length of sequence is not a power of 2 so have to either augment or cut the sequences. For augmenting data, I tried to reflect two tails of data and for cutting data, I tried to retain the parts that are obviously not zeros. In conclusion, smashgen gives more smoothing fit in general. Two problems: is it over-smoothing? how to solve the peak problem?

The primary role of CTCF is thought to be in regulating the 3D structure of chromatin.CTCF binds together strands of DNA, thus forming chromatin loops, and anchors DNA to cellular structures like the nuclear lamina. It also defines the boundaries between active and heterochromatic DNA.

1. [CTCF Chip-exo data, reflection](chipexo.html): use symmetric reflection to extend sequence.
2. [CTCF Chip-exo data, cut](chipexocut.html): cut the sequence.
3. [CTCF Chip-seq data](chipseqref.html)

## DNA methylation data smoothing

1. [BS Cancer data](bsseq.html): DNA methylation data from normal and cancer.

## Variance stabilizing transformation(vst)

In addiiton to likelihood expansion, VST is another way to make data normal dsitributed.

2. [Compare log and anscombe transform](compares.html)
3. [Vst for nugget effect](ansgen.html)
4. [More in anscombe transformation](vstiter.html)

## Wavelet-based Functional data analysis.

1. [Apply smash-gen to functional data analysis](smashgenfda.html)

# Literatures on smoothing

I'm focusing on reading 1. additive models(gam, gamm, spam, gspam); 2. functional data analysis(wavelet based functional mixed models, etc); 3. More on exponential family Signal denoising(vst, tf)

1. [A collection of literatures](literature.html)
2. [additive models](gam.html)
3. [functional data analysis](fda.html)
4. [Signal denoising exponential family](efsd.html)

# Miscellaneous
